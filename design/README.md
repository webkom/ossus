How to use
==========

If you are not building a node.js application then all you need is contained into the public/ folder.
All the source files are in the src/ folder, including all the source .js files and the .less files if you want to make changes to the existing css.

All external js dependencies are included in the public/scripts/vendor/ folder and they are maintained using [Bower](http://bower.io/).

The source for the html pages is located under src/html/ folder and contains handlebars templates.
